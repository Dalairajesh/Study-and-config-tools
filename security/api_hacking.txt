TOP TEN OWASP

1 API1:2019 - BROKEN OBJECT LEVEL AUTHORIZATION (IDOR)
  API tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers,
  creating a wide attack surface level Access Control issue.
  Object level autorization checks should be considered in every
  function that access a data source using input from the user

2 API2:2019 - BROKEN USER AUTHENTICATION
  Authetication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly,
  allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to
  exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities
  temporarily or permanently. Compromising the system's ability to
  identify the client/user, compromises API Security overall

3 API:2019 - EXCESSIVE DATA EXPOSURE
  Looking forward to generic implementation, developers tend to
  expose all object properties without considering their individual
  sensitivity, relying on clients to perform the data filtering before
  displaying it to the user.

4 API:2019 - LACK OF RESOURCES & RATE LIMITING
  Quite Often, API do not impose any restrictions on the size or
  number of resources that can be requested by the client/user. not
  only can this impact the API server performance, leading to
  Denial of Service(DOS), but also leaves the door open to
  authentication flaws such as brute force

5 API:2019 - BROKEN FUNCTION LEVEL AUTHORIZATION
  Complex access Control policies with different hierarchies,
  groups, and roles, and an unclear separation between
  administrative and regular functions, tend to lead to autorization
  flaws. By exploiting these issues, attackers gain access to other
  user's resources and/or administrative functions.
