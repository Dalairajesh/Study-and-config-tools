  Autorize is an extension that helps automate authorization testing, particu-
larly for BOLA vulnerabilities You can add the tokens of UserA and UserB
accounts and then perform a bunch of actions to create and interact with
resources as UserA Also, Autorize can automatically attempt to interact with
UserA’s resources with the UserB account Autorize will highlight any interesting
requests that may be vulnerable to BOLA

APIs We will make the most out of this extension

4) IP ROTATE
 IP Rotate allows you to alter the IP address you are attacking from to indicate
different cloud hosts in different regions This is extremely useful against API
providers that simply block attacks based on IP address

5)BYPASS WAF
The WAF Bypass extension adds some basic headers to your requests in order
to bypass some web application firewalls (WAFs) Some WAFs can be tricked
by the inclusion of certain IP headers in the request WAF Bypass saves you
from manually adding headers such as X-Originating-IP, X-Forwarded-For,
X-Remote-IP, and X-Remote-Addr These headers normally include an IP address,
and you can specify an address that you believe to be permitted, such as the
target’s external IP address (127 0 0 1) or an address you suspect to be trusted
